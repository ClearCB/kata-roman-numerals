IMPORTANT! All the starting information was provided by my teacher before doing the exam. (UML, userstories, etc.)

This exercise was created by my teacher dfleata to train regular expresions and enum types in java: [start statement and solution](https://github.com/dfleta/romans-go-home)

I based the architecture at the one my teacher did, tried to solve it easily.

## Description

The porpouse of this kata is to create an application that translate a valid roman number into a decimal number.

The roman rules of numeration that we follow are located [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) (we also checked the spanish wikipedia of it)

```cmd
MMMDCCCLXXXVIII = 3888
MMDCCLXXVII = 2777
CDXLIV = 444
CDXXXIX = 439
```

This should be the CLI output when you execute the app.
